See [[Reports]].\n4. **Flexibility**: The platform's flexibility is enhanced by the availability of plugins from the Matomo Plugin Marketplace, allowing users to extend and customize its capabilities as needed.\n5. **Self-Hosting Option**: Matomo provides a self-hosting option, giving users full control over their data and eliminating reliance on external servers.\n6. **Free Matomo APIs**: The availability of Matomo APIs for free enables developers to integrate Matomo with other applications or create custom functionalities tailored to their specific needs.\n7. **Customizability with Widgets API**: The Widgets API allows users to customize their Matomo experience further by creating and integrating widgets that suit their reporting requirements.\n\nCons\n\n1. **Resource Intensive**: Hosting Matomo on your own server can be resource-intensive, particularly if your website receives a large volume of traffic. This might require substantial server resources and technical expertise to manage efficiently. See [[Requirements and Recommendations]].\n2. **Complex Setup and Maintenance**: Setting up Matomo and ensuring its proper maintenance can be more involved compared to using cloud-based analytics services. It demands regular updates, security patches, and monitoring to keep the system running smoothly.\n3. **Limited Support for Third-Party Integrations**: While Matomo has a marketplace for plugins, it may not offer the same extensive range of integrations with third-party tools that some other analytics platforms provide. This could be a drawback if you heavily rely on specific third-party services.\n4. **Learning Curve**: Users who are new to Matomo might find a steeper learning curve when compared to Google Analytics. Familiarizing yourself with the interface, features, and customization options might take some time.\n5. **Limited Free Version Features**: While Matomo does offer a free version, some of the more advanced features and functionalities might be available only in paid plans, which could be a downside for users with specific requirements. See [[Self-Hosted Limitations]].\n6. **Community vs. Enterprise Support**: While Matomo has an active community, the level of support and response time for resolving issues might not be as fast or comprehensive as with enterprise-level analytics providers.\n\n## Navigation\n\n- [Data Collection](Data%20Collection.md)\n- [Features](Features.md)\n- [Installation](Installation.md)\n- [Pricing](Pricing.md)\n- [Pros and Cons](Pros%20and%20Cons.md)\n- [Reports](Reports.md)\n- [Requirements and Recommendations](Requirements%20and%20Recommendations.md)\n- [Self-Hosted Limitations](Self-Hosted%20Limitations.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-28T05:26:35.962972446Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Reports":{"title":"Reports","content":"\nThese are the reports that Matomo can generate:\n\n- [Dashboard](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/dashboard/)\n- [A/B Testing](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/a-b-testing/)\n- [Acquisition and Marketing Channels](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/acquisition-and-marketing-channels/)\n- [Behaviour](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/behaviour/)\n- [Cohorts](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/cohorts/)\n- [Content Tracking](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/content-tracking/)\n- [Ecommerce](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/ecommerce/)\n- [Event Tracking](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/event-tracking/)\n- [Form Analytics](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/form-analytics/)\n- [Funnels](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/funnels/)\n- [Goals and Conversions](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/goals-and-conversions/)\n- [Heatmaps](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/heatmaps/)\n- [Media Analytics](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/media-analytics/)\n- [Multi Channel Conversion Attribution](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/multi-channel-conversion-attribution/)\n- [Page Overlay](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/page-overlay/)\n- [Page Transitions](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/page-transitions/)\n- [Real-time reports](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/real-time-reports/)\n- [SEO Web Vitals](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/seo-web-vitals/)\n- [Session Recordings](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/session-recordings/)\n- [Site Search](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/site-search/)\n- [User IDs](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/user-ids/)\n- [Users Flow](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/users-flow/)\n- [Visitors](https://matomo.org/guide/reports/visitors/)\n\n## Navigation\n\n- [Data Collection](Data%20Collection.md)\n- [Features](Features.md)\n- [Installation](Installation.md)\n- [Pricing](Pricing.md)\n- [Pros and Cons](Pros%20and%20Cons.md)\n- [Reports](Reports.md)\n- [Requirements and Recommendations](Requirements%20and%20Recommendations.md)\n- [Self-Hosted Limitations](Self-Hosted%20Limitations.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-28T05:26:35.962972446Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Requirements-and-Recommendations":{"title":"Requirements and Recommendations","content":"\n## Minimum Requirements\n\n- Webserver such as Apache, [Nginx](https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo-nginx), IIS, LiteSpeed, etc.\n- Matomo 4.x requires PHP version 7.2.5 or greater.
