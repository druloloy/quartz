## Pre-installation Process

Before we start the installation, open the server using SSH.

```
$ ssh forge@192.168.1.1
```

> Replace the `192.168.1.1` with the right server address.

Go to the website's directory e.g. `analytics.spiralytics.net`

```
$ cd analytics.spiralytics.net
```

Download Matomo from the official source `https://builds.matomo.org/matomo.zip`

```
$ wget https://builds.matomo.org/matomo.zip && unzip matomo.zip
```

> This initial process only works if you have SSH access to the server.

After setting up the files, let us create a MySQL user and the database to be used by our Matomo.

```
CREATE USER 'matomodb'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'randompassword';
CREATE DATABASE matomodb; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON matomodb.* TO 'matomodb'@'localhost';
```

> You may want to replace the `randompassword` with stronger password.

Great! We now have a MySQL user and a database for our Matomo Analytics. We'll now proceed to the installation process.

## 5-Minute Installation Process

Open our website through its URL e.g. `analytics.spiralytics.net`. You will be greeted by a Welcome Page.

### Welcome Page

Click "Next", Matomo will check to make sure that your server meets the [[Requirements and Recommendations]]. If everything is okay, you’ll see a long list like this:

### System Check

If there is a problem, Matomo will identify it and tell you how to solve it, as in this example:

When all the requirements are met, click "Next".

### MySQL Database Setup

Enter this information according to how we set the credentials earlier.

| Key             | Value          | Addtional Information                                                 |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database Server | 127.0.0.1      | Keep this in localhost since our database runs on the server          |
| Login           | matomodb       | Enter your database user that we've created earlier                   |
| Password        | randompassword | Enter your user password                                              |
| Database Name   | matomodb       | Enter the database that we created earlier                            |
| Table Prefix    | matomo\_       | This prefix will be added before your table names e.g. _matomo_users_ |

Once done, click "Next".

### Superuser

The super user is the user that you create when you install Matomo. This user has the highest permissions. Choose your username and password:

Once finished, Click "Next".

### Install the JavaScript Tracking Tag

Install the JavaScript Tracking Tag generated by Matomo on every page you want to analyze. We recommend placing this code right before the closing `</head>` tag or in a shared header file included at the top of all your pages.
